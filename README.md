# SVCollege notebook

This project gives easy access to my vanilla-code lessons from Frontend bootcamp at
[SVCollege](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=svcollege&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8).<br />
The course covered the following topics:<br />

- HTML (fundementals)
- CSS (fundementals)
- Bootstrap (introduction)
- JavaScript
- React.js

To view all the files and code, you can use the
[Study Material](https://github.com/belferink1996/SVCollege-notebook/tree/main/Study%20Material)
directory.<br /> To view the UI of all the files, you can use
[this link](https://belferink1996.github.io/SVCollege-notebook/) to access the notebook.<br />
**Note**! The notebook was created with vanilla code, the React.js lessons are _not supported_ in
the UI...
